Before you can use Bayesian optimization, you need to install `RoBO <https://github.com/automl/RoBO>`_ first.
Have a look `here <http://automl.github.io/RoBO/installation.html>`_ to see how you can install it.

If you want to use `SMAC <https://github.com/automl/SMAC3>`_, you have to install it first from pypi:

.. code:: bash

  pip install smac

In case you want to install manually, look `here <https://automl.github.io/SMAC3/stable/installation.html#manual-installation>`_
